# Portforlio_Site

To take a look at my portfolio via browser, all you need in order to access my codes is to click on the CSS and Html links below the "About" in the GitHub page.

To view my code for correction, comments and/or compare it with a given project of the same or so, you can download my files and open them in whatever coding application of your choice such as VS code, Atom, Text Editor, or directly in this GitHub page by clicking the CSS folder or the html folder. This will give you access to the main code files.

To make things clear, the CSS folder contains 2 files. One is the styles.css file where all designs are made for all my html pages or website. The second file you will find is the style.production.css which was generated from the styles.css code after preprocessing.

In case you have any questions or comment donâ€™t  hessite to contact me through my email via the contact page or even here at GitHub thanks.
